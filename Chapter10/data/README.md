# Data

1. Open: The price at the beginning of the minute
2. High: The maximum price during the interval
3. Low: The minimum price
4. Close: The last price of the minute time interval
5. Value: the number of buy and sell orders performed during the bar (market-dependent, give an idea about how active the market was)

Every minute interval is called a bar
